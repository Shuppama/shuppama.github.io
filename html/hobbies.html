        <h2>Hobbies</h2>
        <p>One of my favorite hobbies is gaming. I enjoy playing a variety of games, from action-packed shooters to immersive role-playing games. Gaming allows me to unwind and have fun.</p>
        <p>Another hobby of mine is coding random stuff. I love experimenting with different programming languages and creating small projects cause why not.</p>
        <p>Lastly, I love going to the gym even tho I don't go very often, instead I spend time with my girlfriend.</p>
