        <h2>More About Me</h2>
        <p>I was born in Portugal on September 10th 2008, lived here my whole life and im still trying to understand what i want for my future even tho i already have some ideas.</p>
        <p>I made this website so i can practice and also so people can learn about me (also i will try to put ads on this site so i can try to get a few cents), maybe one day this site will become useful! (started making on November 27th 2025)</p>
